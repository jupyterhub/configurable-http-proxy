## [Unreleased]

## 5.0

### 5.0.0 (prerelease) - 2025-05

5.0.0 is a major revision, though there are no feature changes in this package.
_Hopefully_ the only change folks should see is improved stability and resource usage.

Major changes:

- The long-abandoned `http-proxy` dependency,
  which implements most of what configurable-http-proxy actually does,
  has been replaced with `http-proxy-3`, a fully compatible, updated and modern fork.
  This should hopefully fix a lot of resource exhaustion and other issues folks have been seeing.
  Thank you @williamstein!
- The minimum nodejs runtime is now node 18 (up from 10).
  This won't affect most users, as node 18 has already reached end-of-life at time of release,
  but folks who get node from their distro package manager (e.g. `apt` or `yum`) often lag behind.
  Node 18 is in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Debian 12/Stable.
- CHP now uses ESM instead of CommonJS (`import` instead of `require`).
  This shouldn't have any visible effect,
  except for anyone calling `require("configurable-http-proxy")` on node 18,
  which doesn't support CommonJS `require` of an ES Module.
  `require("configurable-http-proxy")` works as before on node >=20.
- nodejs runtime in the quay.io/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy image is increased to node 24 from node 20.

### [4.3.0] - 2021-03-05

4.3 is a small release that should mostly improve behavior
when things are going wrong,
especially when endpoints are unavailable and clients are still trying to talk to them.

- improved error handling and quieter logging in these cases,
  especially when running on node >= 12.9.

### [4.1]

### [4.1.0] - 2019-04-01

- Add `--redirect-to` option to specify destination port when redirecting
  http to https with `--redirect-from`.
- Add health check endpoint at `/_chp_healthz`.
- Docker base image is updated to `node/10-alpine` from `node/6-alpine`
- Dependencies are updated via Renovate

## 4.0

### [4.0.0] - 2018-10-12

- Add support for client SSL certificates for encrypting proxied requests.
- Update all nodejs dependencies. Most significant is updating winston (logging) from 2 to 3. There is no longer a global logger,
  instead use `this.log`.
- Drop support for node 4. Minimum node version is 6.
- Support CONFIGPROXY_SSL_KEY_PASSPHRASE env for setting the passphrase of ssl keys (API_SSL for api ssl key).

## [3.1]

### [3.1.1] - 2018-01-15

- Fix a bug when using the new custom storage backend support
  where the body of requests could be lost.

### [3.1.0] - 2017-11-03

3.1 adds two new features:

- Add `--change-origin` passthrough for node-http-proxy's changeOrigin option.
- Add support via `--storage-backend <storage-class>` for custom storage classes.
  See [configurable-http-proxy-redis-backend](https://github.com/globocom/configurable-http-proxy-redis-backend)
  for an example using redis.

## [3.0]

### [3.0.0] - 2017-09-19

3.0 is a major release because much of the code has been reorganized
to adopt some javascript standards:

- Use ES6 and Promises instead of ES5 and callbacks,
  which we can do without a compiler because CHP 2.0 required nodejs < 4.
- auto-format code with prettify (run `npm run fmt` to auto-format your code after making changes).

There shouldn't be any major changes in 3.0, but marking it as a major upgrade because
there could be regressions introduced by the restructuring.

Fixes:

- Fix routing of `/prefix?query` where a query parameter was passed
  exactly on the routing prefix with no trailing slash.

Improvements:

- Quieter messages for ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET,
  which are generally not indicative of problems,
  but rather common events of peers disconnecting during a request.
- The docker image for `jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy`
  is now based on `node:6-alpine`.

## [2.0]

### 2.0.4 - 2017-06-21

- Add logging of all API requests

### 2.0.3 - 2017-06-12

- Fix docker image entrypoint, broken in 2.0.2

### 2.0.2 - 2017-06-07

- Fix error raised trying to `setHeader` on an undefined response (e.g. when encountering socket-level error)

### 2.0.1

**Important** CHP 2.0.0 drops support for node.js ≤ 4.0.

**Added:**

- Add configuration option for proxy timeout `--proxy-timeout <n>, Timeout (in millis) when proxy receives no response from target.`
  [\#86](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy/pull/86)
- Add configuration options for auto rewrite and protocol rewrite
  [\#73](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy/pull/73):
  - `--auto-rewrite, Rewrite the Location header host/port in redirect responses`
  - `--protocol-rewrite <proto>', Rewrite the Location header protocol in redirect responses to the specified protocol`
- Add low-level code for separate stores of routes to enable future support of other data stores such as Redis [\#81](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy/pull/81)

**Changed:**

- Support only LTS releases and above for NodeJS [\#82](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy/pull/82).
  This means only ≥ 4.0 are supported.

**Fixed:**

- Fix behavior to correctly handle children when a parent node is deleted [\#93](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy/pull/93)
- Fix closure reference when serving custom error pages [\#91](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy/pull/91)
- Improved all-interfaces warning message when `ip='*'` [\#94](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy/pull/94)

## [1.3]

### [1.3.1] - 2016-10-12

- small fixes for node 6 support
- fix `--no-x-forward` again (for real, this time)

### [1.3.0] - 2016-08-01

- add `--ssl-protocol`, so that one can restrict to TLS, e.g. `--ssl-protocol=TLSv1`
- fix handling of ``--no-x-forward`

## [1.2] - 2016-04-19

- add statsd support

## [1.1] - 2016-01-04

- add `--ssl-request-cert` args for certificate-based client authentication
- fix some SSL parameters that were ignored for API requests

## [1.0] - 2016-01-04

- add `ConfigProxy.proxy_request` event, for customizing requests as the pass through the proxy.
- add more ssl-related options for specifying options on the CLI.
- fix regression in 0.5 where deleting a top-level route would also delete the default route.

## [0.5] - 2015-10-05

- add `--error-target` for letting another http server render error pages.
  Server must handle `/404` and `/503` URLs.
- add `--error-path` for custom static HTML error pages.
  `[CODE].html` will be used if it exists, otherwise `error.html`.
- fix bug preventing root route from being deleted

## [0.4] - 2015-10-02

- add `--redirect-port` for automatically redirecting a common port to the correct one (e.g. redirecting http to https)

## [0.3] - 2015-04-29

- fixes for URL escaping
- add host-based routing

## [0.2.1] - 2014-11-21

## [0.2.0] - 2014-11-14

## [0.1.1] - 2014-10-01
